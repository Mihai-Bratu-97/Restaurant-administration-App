who will tell him if the product he wants to order is still available, the time of the product until it's ready, and also to communicate with a lot of different app,
for ordering online, and also for employees, to help them in doing their jobs easier. It's not finished yet. And works only on Windows for now.
All of this were made in Python along with its libraries.
You have to download the images.rar in order to work properly the App, and to put them in the same folder where you put the other files, and to change the path
